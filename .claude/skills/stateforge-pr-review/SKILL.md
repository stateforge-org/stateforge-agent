# StateForge Pull Request Review

Assist with one explicitly selected DPT milestone and its GitHub Issue. Do
not broaden the review into the next procedure or redesign unrelated code.

## Establish the review basis

Read `CLAUDE.md`, root `STATEFORGE_DPT.md`, applicable repository skills, and
the active issue or requested outcome. Determine the intended base and inspect
the actual diff. If the base is ambiguous, report the assumption rather than
silently reviewing an arbitrary comparison.

Follow `.agents/skills/stateforge-dpt-milestone/SKILL.md` for assignment
mapping and the human handoff. Local implementation commits are allowed.
Humans own GitHub mutations, PR creation, formal review/approval, and merging.
An agent's review findings are advisory and do not substitute for that human
review. Do not submit a formal GitHub review or approval as part of this skill.

## Review in priority order

1. Correctness, data loss, security, deadlocks, races, and recovery failures.
2. Violation of Agent, Provider, Protocol, BackupEngine, or process boundaries.
3. Wire/API compatibility, ownership, idempotency, replay, cancellation, and
   error semantics.
4. Missing observable behavior, failure coverage, documentation, packaging, or
   generated-artifact updates.
5. Python clarity, typing, docstrings, and unnecessary abstractions.

Apply the repository's StateForge Python-development skill to handwritten
Python. Apply the protocol-development skill to SFP changes. Prefer cohesive,
direct code; do not demand helpers, layers, or patterns unless they materially
improve reuse, clarity, or separation of concerns.

Tests are automated behavioral gates. Inspect them as evidence for changed
behavior, but do not conduct a separate stylistic review of test files unless
the user requests it.

## Review protocol ownership explicitly

For any SFP-facing diff, inspect the matching Protocol, Agent, and Provider
surfaces even when only one repository may be changed. Require a responsibility
matrix covering wire shape, service and RPC identity, procedure limits,
shared scalar semantics, context-independent validation, endpoint discovery,
and aggregate transport ceilings.

Treat copied constants, parsers, validators, names, or limits in a consumer as
an ownership defect even when tests show matching behavior. Confirm that
Protocol exposes the complete normative rule, that Agent and Provider import
it, and that consumer-owned checks genuinely depend on local state or policy.
Require Protocol contract tests plus consumer delegation or ownership tests.
Do not report complete separation while a repository, registered procedure, or
responsibility category remains unaudited.

## Report actionable findings

Lead with concrete findings ordered by severity:

- `P0`: release-blocking or destructive;
- `P1`: correctness, security, or compatibility failure;
- `P2`: important maintainability or incomplete-contract problem;
- `P3`: small improvement that is worth fixing.

For each finding, identify the narrow file and line range, explain the actual
failure or risk, and state the expected behavior. Do not manufacture findings
to fill a category. If there are no findings, say so and identify any remaining
verification gap.

Keep review comments human and specific. Avoid generic praise, restating the
diff, or turning personal style preferences into blockers.

## Verify and hand off

Run the applicable configured quality gates. Distinguish a passing check from a
check that was not available. Do not mark a plan item implemented solely
because documentation exists or because the diff looks complete.

When asked to prepare a pull request, draft:

- the `[TASK][MVP] ...` title;
- a short explanation of why the change is needed;
- the behavior present after merge;
- verification performed;
- deliberate non-goals or follow-up dependencies.

Report implementation and verification evidence in the handoff, not by
editing `STATEFORGE_DPT.md` or SQLite or invoking DPT to change status.
A local implementation, commit, passing check, review, or PR draft does not
complete the DPT step. Humans open, review, and merge the correctly associated
PR; DPT reconciliation derives the delivered state from GitHub evidence.
Stop at the handoff without pushing or beginning another milestone.
